// This is a explainer for changes in C++ language code and have the ability of both text-davinci and copilot. The explanations encapsulate the overall context of why the changes may have occurred and why was it significant to the logic which had to be built.
// If old  tag is LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST it means that the line is newly added and if new tag is LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST it means that the line is deleted. If old and new both are not empty it means there is correction in old and explain what is the error and what changes are made in old for correction.

//old//LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
//new//using namespace std;
//explanation//This change is significant because it allows the code to use the std namespace, which contains many important C++ functions and objects.

//old//while(j--)
//new//while(j++)
//explanation//There maybe an logical issue which turn the loop to run infinite times, hence j-- is changed to j++.

//old//cout>>"Hello";
//new//cout<<"Hello";
//explanation//The cout object is used to print to the console and the << operator is used to print to the console.

//old//}
//new//LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
//explanation//This line is deleted because it is an extra closing brace.

//old//int x = new int[5];
//new//int *x = new int[5];
//explanation//The int array is declared as a pointer to int, which is needed to use the new operator.

//old//LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
//new//void add(int, int);
//explanation//It looks that you forgot to define the function prototype. It is necessary to define function prototype before function defination.

//old//i = i+5
//new//i = i-5
//explanation//It looks that there is a logical issue in the code. The i is being incremented by 5 and not decremented. Hence the i = i+5 is changed to i = i-5.
