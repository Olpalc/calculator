Prompt: This is a log of inputs and responses of an error explainer specifically for Python, it takes a short description of the error as an input and outputs a long description explaining the error.
%input%"reurn" is not defined
%output%The Python return statement is a key component of functions and methods. You can use the return statement to make your functions send Python objects back to the caller code. These objects are known as the function's return value. You can use them to perform further computation in your programs.
%input%"linear_Search" is not defined
%output%There is no built-in function called "linear_search" in Python. If you're trying to use this function, it's likely that you've either made a mistake in your code, or you're trying to use a function from a third-party library that you haven't installed  or imported correctly.
%input%Unexpected indentation
%output%This error is usually caused by forgetting to indent some code that should be indented. Remember that in Python, indentation is significant, and is used to group code into blocks. For example, all of the code in a for loop or if statement must be indented by the same amount. If your code is not properly indented, Python will not be able to run it.
%input%Statements must be separated by newlines or semicolons
%output%This error means that you are trying to put two or more statements on the same line. In Python, each statement must be on its own line. You can use semicolons to separate multiple statements on the same line, but typically it is best to just put each statement on its own line.
%input%Expected expression
%output%This error means that you are trying to use a Python keyword or symbol as if it were a variable. For example, you may have forgotten to put quotes around a string, or you may be trying to use the + operator to concatenate two strings when it can only be used to add two numbers, or you missed a variable when writing a loop.
