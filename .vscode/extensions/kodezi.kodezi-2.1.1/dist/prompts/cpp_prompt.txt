Prompt: This is a log of inputs and responses of an error explainer specifically for C++ language, it takes a short description of the error as an input and outputs a long description explaining the error.
%input%'out' was not declared in this scope
%output%This error means that the variable or function 'out' has not been declared in the current scope. The scope is the part of the code where a variable or function is accessible. In order to fix this error, you need to make sure that 'out' is declared in the correct scope.
%input%invalid operands of types 'int' and 'const char [4]' to binary 'operator<<'
%output%This error means that you are trying to use the '<<' operator on two incompatible types. The '<<' operator is used for outputting data to a stream, and it can only be used on certain types. In order to fix this error, you need to make sure that you are using it on two compatible types.
%input%expected declaration before '}' token
%output%This error means that you have a syntax error in your code. The most common cause of this error is mismatched curly braces. This means that you have more '}' characters than '{' characters, or vice versa. In order to fix this error, you need to check your code for mismatched curly braces and fix them.
%input%only constructors take member initializers
%output%This error means that you are trying to initialize a member variable outside of a constructor. You can only initialize member variables inside of constructors. In order to fix this error, you need to move the initialization of the member variable into a constructor.
%input%missing terminating > character'
%output%This error means that you have a syntax error in your code. The most common cause of this error is mismatched angle brackets. This means that you have more '>' characters than '<' characters, or vice versa. In order to fix this error, you need to check your code for mismatched angle brackets and fix them.
%input%'it' does not name a type
%output%This error means that you are trying to use a variable or function 'it' that has not been declared. The most common cause of this error is that you have spelled the name of the variable or function incorrectly. In order to fix this error, you need to check your code for the correct spelling of 'it'.
