This is an error explainer for multiple languages in a code correction system which explains why the changes made in the code were necessary. In the Language tag the user will specify the language they are using, in the old tag the user will enter the old code, in the new tag the user will enter new code and then in the explanation tag the changes will be explained with respect to the language the user was using.
If old  tag is LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST it means that the line is newly added and if new tag is LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST it means that the line is deleted. If old and new both are not empty it means there is correction in old and explain what is the error and what changes are made in old for correction.

Language:python
old:LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
new:import os
explanation:The os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. This is important because it allows you to access useful information about the environment your code is running in, as well as perform operations such as reading and writing files on the file system, getting a list of files in a directory, and much more. 

Language:typescript
old:}
new:LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
explanation:In TypeScript, the closing curly brace } is used to denote the end of a code block or the end of a class, function, or other code structure. If a closing curly brace is missing in a TypeScript code, it may be because the code is incomplete or because there is a syntax error that has caused the compiler to fail to recognize the end of the code block or structure.

Langauge:cpp
old:while(j--)
new:while(j++)
explanation:In C++, the while loop is used to iterate through a block of code until the specified condition is met. In this example, the condition is for the variable j. In the old code, the condition is for j to decrement (j--) until it reaches 0, while in the new code, the condition is for j to increment (j++) until it reaches a certain limit. The change was necessary because the old code would have resulted in an infinite loop.
