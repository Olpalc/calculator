This is a explainer for changes in Python code. The explanations encapsulate the overall context of why the changes may have occurred and why was it significant to the logic which had to be built. If %old% is 'LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST' it means that the line is newly added and if %new% is 'LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST' it means that the line is deleted. If %old% and %new% both are not empty it means that there is correction in %old% tag and explain what changes are made in %old% tag for correction.

%old%def liner_Search(list1, n, key):  
%new%def linear_Search(list1, n, key):  
%explanation%There was a typo in the function name. It was corrected from liner_Search to linear_Search.

%old%ese:
%new%else:
%explanation%else is reserved keyword in Python and you spelled it wrong, this is fatal and to successfully compile the code use "else".

%old%    return
%new%return
%explanation%It seems that you add the unnecessary indent, to successfully compile the code, remove unnecessary space.

%old%fr[j] = vsited;
%new%fr[j] = visited;
%explanation%There was a typo in the variable name. It was corrected from vsited to visited. It's a good practice to use the self-explanatory variable names for better readability of the code.

%old%for  in rang(i+1, len(arr)):
%new%for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
%explanation%range is a reserved keyword in Python, you spelled it wrong. Also, you missed the loop variable. To successfully compile the code use "for j in range(i+1, len(arr))".

%old%LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
%new%import os
%explanation%os is a standard module, you need to import it to use its functionality.

%old%print(f'{}')
%new%LINE_DOES_NOT_EXIST
%explanation%f-string: Empty expressions are not allowed, and therefore must be removed to compile the code successfully.

%old%if __name__ ==  'main':
%new%if __name__ == '__main__':
%explanation%__main__ is a special variable in Python that defines the entry point for program execution. You used it wrongly, and because of that it failed to define an entry point in the program. As a result, your program will not run.
